# COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis

The training dataset can be found here (it is also included in the data folder so it will not need to be redownloaded): https://www.kaggle.com/imrandude/twitter-sentiment-analysis

Below are the steps to run this project:

1) To view how the data was scraped, please refer to "scrape_tweets.ipynb". This file can be ran, although it is not recommended because the dates and search terms have to be manually switched to obtain the entire dataset (due to Twitter's connection restraints in terms of continuous scraping).

2) The analysis was done in the "working_system.ipynb" file. All the data referenced/required in the file can be found in the "data" folder. This program reads the data from the data folder. The program needs to be placed outside the "data" folder to successfully run.
